Originally bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, this project has been upgraded to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

It uses [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io) for styling, and it contains the built output of my senior project for my Bachelor's degree (source code found [here](https://github.com/EmilyRagan/senior-project)).
